Hi there!

My name is Laurent, I'm a software engineer based in London. I like writing elegant and maintainable test-driven applications.

After graduating from business school, I moved from France to London and worked in strategy consulting and digital media for two years. In 2008, I moved to Paris to co-found cafedelabourse.com, an online investing magazine. That's when I caught the bug of web developement.

In 2014 I decided to become a full-time professional software engineer and signed up for a three-month programming bootcamp in London. Since graduation, I have worked at Alphasights and the Government Digital Service. In May 2018 I joined 8th Light as a Resident Apprentice.
