## Email Body

Hi [First Name],

I'm Laurent, a fractional CTO based here in Monaco. I help growing businesses build software, make smart technology decisions, and avoid costly technical mistakes—without the commitment of a full-time hire.

I noticed [Company Name] and thought you might benefit from technical leadership that scales with your needs. Many local businesses I work with face similar challenges:

- Needing to build an MVP or internal tool but unsure where to start
- Making technology decisions without senior technical guidance
- Wanting to hire developers but lacking expertise to evaluate candidates

I've helped 30+ companies navigate these challenges, delivering €2M+ in value with a 95% client satisfaction rate.

**How I can help:**
- Build MVPs and internal tools quickly
- Guide your tech stack and architecture decisions
- Mentor your development team
- Help you recruit the right engineers

The best part? My engagements are designed to make me replaceable—I document everything and ensure a smooth handover when you're ready to bring someone in-house.

Would you be open to a quick 15-minute call to see if I can help? You can book directly here: https://cal.com/laurentcurau

Either way, I wish you continued success with [Company Name].

Best,
Laurent Curau
Fractional CTO

## Customization Tips

1. **Research first**: Mention something specific about their business (recent funding, new product, job posting for developers)
2. **Personalize the pain point**: If they posted a developer job, lead with recruitment help. If they're a startup, lead with MVP development.
3. **Keep it short**: This template is already at the upper limit—trim if possible
4. **Follow up**: Send a polite follow-up after 5-7 days if no response

## Example Personalized Opening

Instead of the generic opening, try:

> "I saw [Company Name] just raised a seed round—congratulations! As you scale, having fractional technical leadership can help you move faster without overspending on a full-time CTO."

or

> "I noticed you're hiring a junior developer. Having a senior technical lead to guide them can dramatically accelerate their productivity and ensure code quality from day one."
